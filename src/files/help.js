const help = `You can navigate by typing commands in the terminal just like you do in macOS or linux.
use "cd" to change into a directory or use "ls" to list the contents of that directory. 
The contents of a file can be viewed using "cat".

Commands supported currently are:
cat  cd  ls  clear  help  pwd

Ofc they are case insensitive and more will coming soon!`
